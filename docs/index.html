<h1> ðŸ™… ChadFreeZone</h1>

<h2> What do Kyles, Chads, Zacharys, and Jasonâ€™s have in common? They suck at texting you back. <br><br> And internet, youâ€™re right. Weâ€™ve run the numbers and the names above truly will ruin your life. 
Chadfreezone is here to make sure those boys never get the chance even if they do look like hotties.

<br><br>
The Chadfreezone Chrome Extension let's you auto swipe left on anyone with a forbidden name on Tinder. We know Tinder's a great app, but if Tinder won't ban people with names like "Zachary," we'll take matters into our own hands. 
<br>
<br>

Select from the names below and we'll make sure they never get the chance to ruin your life. </h2>
